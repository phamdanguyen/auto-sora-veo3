## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### Before (Monolithic)
```
app/
├── endpoints.py (1,237 lines - everything mixed)
├── worker_v2.py (1,447 lines - tightly coupled)
└── models.py (ORM only)
```

### After (Clean Architecture)
```
app/
├── api/
│   └── routers/        # Modular routers (SRP)
│       ├── accounts.py (274 lines)
│       ├── jobs.py     (417 lines)
│       └── system.py   (200 lines)
├── core/
│   ├── domain/         # Domain models (DDD)
│   ├── repositories/   # Repository Pattern (DIP)
│   ├── services/       # Business logic (SRP)
│   └── workers/        # Worker system (OCP)
└── legacy/             # Backward compatibility
```

## 🎨 SOLID Principles Applied

### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each router handles one resource type
- Each service manages one business domain
- Each worker handles one task type

### ✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- DriverFactory for adding new platforms without modifying existing code
- BaseWorker for extending worker types
- Strategy patterns for account selection

### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All drivers implement `IDriver` interface
- Workers follow `BaseWorker` contract
- Polymorphic driver usage

### ✅ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Domain models split by concern (Auth, Session, Credits)
- Specific repository methods (get_credits, get_session)
- Focused service interfaces

### ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- High-level modules depend on abstractions
- Dependency injection throughout
- Repository pattern abstracts data access

## 🔄 Breaking Changes

### API Changes
- ❌ Legacy `endpoints.py` moved to `app/legacy/`
- ✅ New modular routers at `/api/accounts`, `/api/jobs`, `/api/system`
- ✅ Legacy endpoints still available at `/api/legacy` for backward compatibility

### Worker System
- ❌ Old `worker_v2.py` and `worker_download.py` removed from `app/core/`
- ✅ New WorkerManager with modular workers
- ✅ Legacy workers preserved in `app/legacy/` if needed

### Import Paths
```python
# OLD
from app.api.endpoints import create_account
from app.core.worker_v2 import Worker

# NEW
from app.api.routers.accounts import router as accounts_router
from app.core.workers.manager import WorkerManager
```
